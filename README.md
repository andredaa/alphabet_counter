# alphabet_counter
# This a a script for counting in a number system based on the alphabet.
# It loops through the numbers from start_value to stop_value and converts each number into a string
# The conversion is following a 26 based number system, in which 1 =a and 26  = z
# Examples: 1 = a; 26 = z; 27 = aa;
# cbd
# 3*26² + 2*26^1 + 4 *26^0 = 2084
# aaa
# 1 * 26² + 1* 26^1 + 1 * 26^0 = 703

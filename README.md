# alphabet_counter
This a a script for counting in a number system based on the alphabet.
It loops through the numbers from start_value to stop_value and converts each number into a string
The conversion is following a 26 based number system, in which 1 =a and 26  = z <br />
Examples: <br />
a = 1 <br />
z = 26 <br />
aa = 1* 26^1 + 1*26^0 = 27 <br />
aaa = 1 * 26² + 1* 26^1 + 1 * 26^0 = 703 <br />
cbd = 3*26² + 2*26^1 + 4 *26^0 = 2084 <br />
